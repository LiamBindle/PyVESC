# PyVESC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LiamBindle/PyVESC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LiamBindle/PyVESC) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyvesc/badge/?version=latest)](http://pyvesc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
PyVESC is aimed at being a easy to use and robust python implementation of the
communication protocol used by the
[VESC - Open Source ESC](http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/) by
Benjamin Vedder. Its a great project with a really great community and I'd urge
anyone interested in motor controllers to take a look at it.

That being said, if you're here you probably already know about it. This small
project was written by Liam Bindle for the
[University of Saskatchewan Space Design Team](https://usst.ca)
as our primary language for non-embedded system is Python. You might wonder why
you might need a library to handling packing and parsing VESC messages since
Pythons standard
[struct](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/struct.html)
module is great for almost exaclty this. PyVESC's usefulness comes from the fact
that PyVESC is:
- Well tested
- Robust in handling corrupt packets in a buffer
- Messages are easily extensible so that PyVESC can be used as a generic
  message/codec protocol (ie. at the USST we use PyVESC for sending messages to
  all of our embedded systems)
- Implements a number of common-error catching exceptions to speed up your
  development
